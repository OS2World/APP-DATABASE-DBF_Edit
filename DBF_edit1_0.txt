        Archive Filename: DBF_edit1_0.zip 
       Short Description: Edit fields of .dbf file.
        Long Description: Edits dBASE files (.dbf) in ways that are are 
                          exceptionally difficult to accomplish using 
                          database programs.  Fields (i.e. columns) may be
                          copied, renamed, moved, deleted, and redefined.
                          "Magic" operations, which perform tasks defined 
                          by the programmer, are also available. Programmers
                          can add more such Magic routines.  .DBF files may
                          also be exported/imported in a form that is 
                          readily edited by a REXX program.
