 When RexxBase.SKIPDELETED  is set to 'ON' then all RexxBase functions used to retrieve 
 records will not return a deleted record. This will cause either the next non-deleted 
 record to be returned or a NOT FOUND condition to occur. 

 When set to 'OFF', the default value, deleted records are returned.
